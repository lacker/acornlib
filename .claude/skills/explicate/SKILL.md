name: "Explicate"
description: "Expand the valid but complicated proofs in a module to have more detailed steps, so that they can be found by forced proof search."
---

Sometimes, we have a valid proof, in the sense that its certificate can be verified. But the proof is too complicated, in the sense that the prover cannot re-discover the proof with forced search if we were to lose the certificate. In this situation, we often want to "explicate" the proof, ie to add more detailed steps to the .ac file so that the prover is able to re-discover the proof.

# Prerequisite

We can only explicate when we have a valid proof. So, the first step is to check that we have valid proofs in the module that we want to explicate.

```bash
acorn check MODULENAME
```

Note that module names can be single words like "add_ordered_group" or dot-separated like "comm_ring.binomial".

If the check fails, we won't be able to explicate.

# Explicating One Module

The next step is to figure out which lines we need to explicate. Run forced proof search with `--fail-fast`. Once we find a line that fails, we'll know we need to explicate it.

```bash
acorn verify MODULENAME --force-search --fail-fast
```

If there's a crash or an internal error, that's a bug in Acorn. We should stop explicating and tell the user there's an Acorn bug.

If this command works, we're done with this module.

If we find a line that can't be found by forced search, make note of the line number and go to the next step.

# Explicating One Line

Once we know a line that cannot be found by forced search, select the proof to see its detail.

```bash
acorn select MODULENAME LINENUMBER
```

This will show a list of statements and reasons. Statements that come from:

- definitions
- theorems
- boolean reduction
- simplification

can be used for explication. Insert these statements in the .ac file in front of the line we are explicating. (If the line has a `by` block, instead insert the statements at the end of the `by` block.)

Don't delete statements! You should only have to add new statements.

After modifying the file, run a verify of the _whole module_ to ensure the new lines can all be proven, and update the certs.

```bash
acorn verify MODULENAME
```

If this doesn't verify, something was bad with the code we inserted wrong. Try fixing it so that it verifies.

If it does verify, we can repeat. Try forced proof search on this module again, to see if any lines still need explication.

# Finishing

When you are done explicating a module, run forced proof search on that module. Ideally, it should succeed. If it doesn't, try explicating again.
